ChatGPT is a conversational AI powered by the GPT-3.5 architecture, created by OpenAI. It can generate human-like text responses based on the input provided to it. This repository provides a simple interface and examples for interacting with ChatGPT using Python.

## Getting Started

To get started with ChatGPT, you will need an API key from OpenAI. You can sign up for access on the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatgpt.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd chatgpt
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

### Usage

You can interact with ChatGPT by running the provided Python scripts. Here's a simple example:

```python
from chatgpt import ChatGPT

# Initialize ChatGPT
chatgpt = ChatGPT()

# Define a conversation
conversation = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like today?"},
]

# Get a response from ChatGPT
response = chatgpt.generate_response(conversation)

# Print the response
